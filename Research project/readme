In this research project, I have 
•	To train classification model using algorithm of random forest & XGBoost
•	To fine tune the hyperparameter of the model to optimize the prediction performance of model
•	To evaluate the prediction performance of Conorary Heart Diesease model 

Dataset: Framingham Heart Disease

Cross-Validated XGBoost (70.5%)  has the best prediction performance to predict whether a patient has 10 years risk of CHD, followed by LR (68.6%), Cross-Validated Random Forest (68.6%), XGBoost (67.8%), SVM (67.3%), Random Forest (61.9%), Decision Tree (56.8%) and KNN (54.7%).
